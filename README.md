# kotlin-high-order-function (Functional Programing:)
  #### First-class functions
  Kotlin functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be stored in variables and data structures, passed as arguments to
  and returned from other functions
  The advantages of first-order functions are, when we want to write a function that can work for many scenarios.
  #### Higher-order-function
  A higher order function is a function that either accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function as its return value, or 
  both.Lets take example
    
     ```
       fun stringOperation(str: String, fn: (String) -> String): Unit {
         val applied = fn(str)
         println(applied)
      }
    ```
   -  we have defined a function stringOperation with two parameters,
      - The first parameter is str which is of string type, 
      - Second is a function fn from string to string (it means, second parameter is function accepts a string input and returns another 
      string as the output). Also note the syntax we used to define the function parameter. 
        - The input types are wrapped in parentheses (String)
        - The output type is separated by a thin arrow.
   - If a function receives a lambda as the last parameter, the lambda can be passed outside the parentheses:
     ```
     stringOperation("Hello World"){ str -> str.substring(0..1) }
     
     ```
   - Example for Sting operation is [here](https://github.com/AnerayeVijay/kotlin-higher-order-function/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/com/vijayaneraye/string/StringOperationTest.kt)

```
### Running the Applications

- Go inside `kotlin-beginner`
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
  1. Tell it to overwrite `.idea`, then revert all changes IntelliJ made to that directory
  2. You can run the test cases through IntelliJ or
   run ```gradle build``` from terminal or commandprompt
