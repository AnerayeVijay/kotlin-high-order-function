# kotlin-high-order-function (Functional Programing:)
  #### First-class functions
  Kotlin functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be stored in variables and data structures, passed as arguments to
  and returned from other functions
  #### Higher-order-function
  A higher order function is a function that either accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function as its return value, or 
  both.
